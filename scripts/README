=================================
The Mysterious Mr. Ubvl presents:

a test case instruction counter

Run:

./test.sh <assignment>

e.g. ./test.sh codea

and all available tests will be benchmarked. The individual traces per test
case (containing only instructions near the generated code's labels) are
written to traces/, traces/result.txt contains the aggregated results.

Use something like
  
  sort results.txt > r$USER.txt
  diff r<u...>.txt r<u...>.txt

to compare results with your colleagues.
